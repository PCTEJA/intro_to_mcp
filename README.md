# Understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Welcome! This repository is your **starting point for understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Whether you're a developer, an AI enthusiast, or simply curious about the future of AI integration‚Äîthis guide is for you.

---

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an **open-source standard** designed to provide a universal way for AI models (like LLMs) to communicate with external tools, data sources, and systems.

> Think of it as the **USB-C of AI** ‚Äî a standardized connector allowing any AI to securely and seamlessly interact with external resources.

First introduced by **Anthropic in late 2024**, MCP addresses the complex and brittle nature of traditional custom integrations between AI systems and the external world.

---

## Why MCP Matters

MCP is more than just another protocol. It's a foundational building block for the next generation of AI applications:

- **Standardization**  
  A universal format that eliminates the need for bespoke integrations.

- **Interoperability**  
  Any AI app with an MCP client can connect to any tool with an MCP server.

- **Security**  
  Designed to safely separate AI models from the external systems they access.

- **Reproducibility**  
  Standardized context means more predictable and consistent AI behavior.

- **Democratization**  
  Build tools once, use everywhere ‚Äî no platform lock-in.

## Core Concepts

MCP follows a **client-server architecture**, composed of three main components:

| Component     | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **MCP Host** | An application (e.g. IDE, chat UI) that runs MCP clients and manages user experience. |
| **MCP Client** | Connects the host to external systems via an MCP server, translating model intent into protocol format. |
| **MCP Server** | An external tool, database, or resource interface that exposes capabilities to AI. |

### üîå MCP Server Capabilities

MCP servers can expose three kinds of capabilities:

- **Tools** ‚Äì Executable functions (e.g., send an email, run a database query).
- **Resources** ‚Äì Contextual data for model use (e.g., file contents, search results).
- **Prompts** ‚Äì Reusable interaction templates or workflows.
